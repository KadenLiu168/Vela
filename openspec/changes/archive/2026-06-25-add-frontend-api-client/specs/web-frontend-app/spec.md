## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Shared frontend API client
The web frontend SHALL provide a shared API client module that wraps API requests, parses JSON responses, and exposes endpoint helpers for frontend code.

#### Scenario: Frontend calls API through shared client
- **WHEN** frontend code needs the API health status
- **THEN** it calls a helper from the shared API client module instead of calling `fetch` directly from page or component code

### Requirement: Frontend API client success handling
The shared API client SHALL return parsed response data when the API returns a successful JSON response.

#### Scenario: Successful API response is parsed
- **WHEN** the API returns a 2xx JSON response
- **THEN** the client resolves with the parsed response body

### Requirement: Frontend API client HTTP error handling
The shared API client SHALL raise a normalized client error when the API returns a non-2xx HTTP response.

#### Scenario: HTTP error is normalized
- **WHEN** the API returns a non-2xx response
- **THEN** the client raises an error that identifies the failure as an HTTP error and includes the HTTP status

### Requirement: Frontend API client network error handling
The shared API client SHALL raise a normalized client error when the request fails before an HTTP response is available.

#### Scenario: Network error is normalized
- **WHEN** the browser request fails because the API cannot be reached
- **THEN** the client raises an error that identifies the failure as a network error

### Requirement: Local API integration validation
The web frontend SHALL provide a validation path that performs at least one real request against the local FastAPI service.

#### Scenario: Real local API request succeeds
- **WHEN** the local API service is running
- **THEN** the frontend validation path can call `GET /api/health` through the shared API client and receive the healthy status
