#### Scenario: CLI startup validation succeeds
- **WHEN** a developer runs the CLI smoke validation from the repository root
- **THEN** the validation MUST execute `uv run vela --help` successfully
- **AND** the validation MUST fail if the installed console script cannot import project packages

#### Scenario: CLI database initialization validation succeeds
